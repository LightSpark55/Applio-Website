- Downloading a [voice model](../Voice-Models/Voice-Models.md) is as simple as going to the **Download** tab.

<p className="text-xs text-center mb-12 mt-2">Manual loading alternative: unzip the downloaded .zip file and drag the two files into the Drop files box. Now you can search for models from Applio by simply entering the character name to search in the Search Model section, then copy the model link or download it.</p>

Applio can only download models from Google Drive, Hugging Face, [Applio Web](https://applio.org/models), Discord, Yandex, Pixeldrain and Mediafire. Downloading files from mega may fail!, this is due to malfunction of the dependency.
